        <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language </li>
        <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
        <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Enter your CSS notes here</li>

          <li>CSS was first intended in 1994 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie while working at CERN with a computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The motivation for making CSS was to provide a system to style the information which is being presented and to isolate the process of styling from that of content creation.</li>
          <li>The specifications of CSS are maintained by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</li>
          <li>With CSS we can play with the images and animation.</li>
          <li>With CSS we can make better backgrounds. So backgrounds not any more need to be boring and static</li>
          <li>Without using CSS, it is very typical thing for web designers to lay out their pages with techniques like HTML tables that obstruct accessibility for the vision-impaired users.</li>

          <li>Enter your GIT notes here</li>

          <li>Git is used to tracking changes in the source code. </li>
          <li>The distributed version control tool is used for source code management. </li>
          <li> It allows multiple developers to work together.</li>
          <li>It supports non-linear development through its thousands of parallel branches.</li>

        <h2>javascript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your javascript notes here</li>

          <li>At first, JavaScript was only used to create interactive pages and was limited only to the web browser.</li>
          <li>But now, this language has also become part of server-side coding and is a strong competitor to other languages on the market.</li>
          <li>We can describe it as a text-based programming language used for both client-side and server-side scripting of web pages.</li>
          <li>Where HTML and CSS give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript is responsible for interactive elements that engage the user.</li>
          <li>JavaScript helps users create modern web applications for direct interaction without reloading the page each time.</li>
