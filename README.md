### Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide project is a web application, it allows students to take notes of the main modules covered by the Pre-work of the Boot Camps.
I dea was to create a dash board for the students to have short notes of the main topics of the course pre-work. by doing this execise I learened the basics of HTML, CSS, Git deploment and Java Script. There were few bugs which I faced when did my coding. However those were rectified by thoughrough debuging.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

HTML
CSS
GIT
JavaScript

## Installation

VS Code was used for coding, Chrome Dev Console was was used for debuging. Github was used for version controling and hosting.

## Usage

Users can use any webbrowser to access the Dashboard. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
